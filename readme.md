# Music App

This repository contains the code for a simple Music App webpage that allows users to explore and play songs. The app interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a range of features, including playlist management and song search functionality.

## Features

- Song Details: Each song in the playlist is displayed with a thumbnail image, title, and artist information.
- Music Player: The app features a music player at the bottom, which allows users to play, pause, skip to the next/previous track, and adjust the volume.
- Popular Song and Artists: The app showcases popular songs and artists in separate sections, making it easy for users to discover trending music.

## Getting Started

To use the Music App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the Music App.

## How to Use

- Playlist Navigation: Use the "Playlist," "Last Listening," and "Recommended" buttons to switch between different categories of songs.
- Song Play: Click on the play icon (bi-play-circle-fill) next to each song in the playlist to play the selected track in the music player.
